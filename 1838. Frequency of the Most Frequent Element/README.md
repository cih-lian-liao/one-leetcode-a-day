# 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, you are allowed to increment any element of the array by `1` at most `k` times. Return the maximum possible frequency of any element after applying the above operations.

#### Input:
- An array of integers `nums` of size `n`.
- An integer `k`.

#### Output:
- An integer representing the maximum possible frequency of any element.

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`

### 1. Understand

**Goal**: Maximize the frequency of any single element in the array by distributing `k` increments optimally.

**Input**:
- Array `nums` of size `n`.
- Integer `k` representing the total increments allowed.

**Output**:
- Maximum possible frequency of any element.

**Key Points**:
- Sorting the array helps group the numbers, making it easier to increase smaller elements to match larger ones.
- We are not allowed to decrease any element, only increase.

---

### 2. Match

This problem matches the **sliding window** pattern:
- The array is sorted, and a sliding window is used to find the largest subarray where all elements can be made equal with at most `k` increments.
- Cost of making elements equal = difference between the largest element and each element in the window.

**Relevant Data Structures**:
- Array for sorted `nums`.
- Two pointers for the sliding window.

---

### 3. Plan

**Step-by-Step Approach**:
1. Sort the array `nums`.
2. Use a sliding window with two pointers (`left`, `right`) to maintain a valid window where the cost to make all elements in the window equal does not exceed `k`.
3. Calculate the cost:
   - For the window `[nums[left], ..., nums[right]]`, the cost is:  
     `cost = nums[right] * window_size - sum_of_elements_in_window`
4. If `cost > k`, shrink the window by incrementing `left`.
5. Keep track of the maximum window size during the process.
6. Return the maximum window size.

**Pseudocode**:
```
Sort nums
Initialize left = 0, max_freq = 0, total = 0
Iterate right from 0 to n - 1:
    Add nums[right] to total
    While cost (nums[right] * window_size - total) > k:
        Subtract nums[left] from total
        Increment left
    Update max_freq with max(max_freq, window_size)
Return max_freq
```

---

### 4. Implement

```python
def maxFrequency(nums, k):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # Step 2: Initialize variables
    left = 0
    max_freq = 0
    total = 0  # Keeps track of the sum of elements in the current window

    # Step 3: Iterate through the array
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        # Add nums[right] to the total
        total += nums[right]
        
        # Calculate the cost to make all elements in the window equal
        while (nums[right] * (right - left + 1)) > total + k:
            # Cost exceeds k, shrink the window
            total -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        
        # Update the maximum frequency
        max_freq = max(max_freq, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_freq
```

### 5. Review

**Dry Run with Example**:
#### Input:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 4]
k = 5
```

#### Execution:
1. **Sort**: `nums = [1, 2, 4]`
2. Initialize `left = 0, max_freq = 0, total = 0`.

**Iteration**:
- `right = 0`: 
  - `total = 1`
  - Cost = `nums[0] * 1 - total = 1 * 1 - 1 = 0`
  - Update `max_freq = 1`.

- `right = 1`: 
  - `total = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - Cost = `nums[1] * 2 - total = 2 * 2 - 3 = 1`
  - Update `max_freq = 2`.

- `right = 2`: 
  - `total = 3 + 4 = 7`
  - Cost = `nums[2] * 3 - total = 4 * 3 - 7 = 5`
  - Update `max_freq = 3`.

**Output**:
```python
Result: 3
```

### 6. Evaluate

**Time Complexity**:
- Sorting: O(n log n)
- Sliding Window: O(n)
- Total: O(n log n)

**Space Complexity**:
- Sorting: O(1) additional space if done in-place, or O(n) otherwise.
- Total: O(1).
