# 📘 LeetCode 56: Merge Intervals (English Version – UMPIRE)

### 🧠 U — Understand the Problem

We are given an array of intervals, where each interval is a pair `[start, end]`.
Our goal is to merge all overlapping intervals and return an array of the merged intervals.

**Example:**

```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

**Explanation:** Intervals `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` overlap, so they are merged into `[1,6]`.

---

### 🧩 M — Match to Known Problems

This is a classic **interval merging** problem.
Patterns involved:

* Sorting intervals by start time.
* Iterating and merging if current overlaps with the previous.

---

### 📝 P — Plan

1. Sort the intervals by the start value.
2. Initialize an empty result list called `merged`.
3. Iterate through the sorted intervals:

   * If `merged` is empty or the current interval does **not overlap** with the last one, just add it.
   * Otherwise, merge by updating the `end` of the last interval in `merged`.

### 💻 I — Implement

#### 🐍 Python Version

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Step 1: Sort intervals by the start value
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        merged = []

        # Step 2: Traverse each interval
        for interval in intervals:
            # Case 1: merged is empty or current interval does not overlap
            if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
                merged.append(interval)
            else:
                # Case 2: overlap exists, merge intervals by updating the end
                merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])

        return merged
```

#### 🌐 JavaScript Version

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} intervals
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var merge = function(intervals) {
    // Step 1: Sort intervals by the start value
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    const merged = [];

    // Step 2: Traverse each interval
    for (let interval of intervals) {
        // Case 1: merged is empty or no overlap
        if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.push(interval);
        } else {
            // Case 2: overlap exists, merge intervals
            merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(
                merged[merged.length - 1][1],
                interval[1]
            );
        }
    }

    return merged;
};
```

### 📈 R — Review and Optimize

**Time Complexity:**

* Sorting takes O(n log n)
* Traversing once takes O(n)
  → Overall: **O(n log n)**

**Space Complexity:**

* Result list may store all intervals → **O(n)**

---

### 🔍 E — Evaluate Edge Cases

* Empty input → return `[]`
* One interval → return it directly
* No overlapping → return all intervals as-is

# 📙 中文版本 – UMPIRE 方法練習 LeetCode 56：合併區間

### 🧠 U — 理解問題

我們給定一個區間陣列，每個區間是 `[start, end]`。
目標是把有重疊的區間合併，回傳一個合併後的區間陣列。

**範例：**

```
輸入: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
輸出: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
```

**說明：** `[1,3]` 和 `[2,6]` 有重疊，合併成 `[1,6]`。

---

### 🧩 M — 類比已知問題

這是一個經典的「合併區間」問題。
常見技巧包括：

* 先根據起始值排序。
* 逐個檢查區間是否重疊，有的話就合併。

---

### 📝 P — 擬定計畫

1. 先依照每個區間的 start 值做排序。
2. 建立一個空的 `merged` 陣列來放結果。
3. 遍歷排序後的每個區間：

   * 如果 `merged` 是空的或沒有重疊，就直接加入。
   * 否則就合併，把 `end` 更新為兩者的最大值。

    const merged = [];

    // 步驟2：遍歷每個區間
    for (let interval of intervals) {
        // 情況1：merged 是空的或沒有重疊

            merged.push(interval);
        } else {
            // 情況2：有重疊，合併並更新結束值
            merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(
                merged[merged.length - 1][1],
                interval[1]
            );
        }
    }

    return merged;
};
```

### 📈 R — 檢視與最佳化

**時間複雜度：**

* 排序是 O(n log n)
* 遍歷是 O(n)
  → 總計是 **O(n log n)**

**空間複雜度：**

* 儲存結果的 `merged` 最多 O(n)
  → 所以是 **O(n)**

### 🔍 E — 測試邊界條件

* 空陣列 → 回傳 `[]`
* 只有一個區間 → 直接回傳
* 沒有任何重疊 → 每個區間都照原樣回傳

# 🧠 Spoken-style explanation for **LeetCode 56: Merge Intervals**, step by step, just like in a real coding interview.

### 🗣️ 1. Clarify the Problem

> "Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.
> We are given an array of intervals, where each interval is represented as a pair of integers `[start, end]`.
> Our task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return a new array that contains the merged results.
> If two intervals overlap, meaning one interval starts before the other ends, we should combine them into one."

> "Is that correct? Are there any constraints I should be aware of, like the range of values or the size of the input?"

---

### 🔍 2. Discuss Edge Cases

> "Let me quickly walk through some edge cases:

* If the input array is empty, we should return an empty array.
* If there's only one interval, then no merging is needed—we return that interval as-is.
* If no intervals overlap at all, then the result should be the same as the input.
* If all intervals overlap into one big range, we should merge them all together."

> "Also, should the output intervals be sorted? I assume we don't need to preserve the original order as long as the merging is correct."

---

### 🛠️ 3. Consider Brute-Force and Optimal Approach

> "Okay, now let's think about the brute-force approach.
> One idea would be to compare every pair of intervals to check for overlap and merge them when needed.
> But this would lead to a time complexity of O(n^2), which is inefficient for large input."

> "Instead, a more optimal strategy would be:

1. Sort the intervals based on their starting times.
2. Use a result list to keep track of merged intervals.
3. Iterate through each interval:

   * If the current interval doesn't overlap with the last one in the result, add it directly.
   * If it overlaps, merge them by updating the end of the previous interval."

---

### 💻 4. Explain and Implement Optimal Code

> "Alright, let me implement the optimal solution in Python first, and I’ll walk you through as I go."

```python
def merge(intervals):
    # Step 1: Sort the intervals by start time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    merged = []

    # Step 2: Iterate through the sorted intervals
    for interval in intervals:
        # If merged list is empty or no overlap, add interval
        if not merged or merged[-1][1] < interval[0]:
            merged.append(interval)
        else:
            # There is overlap, so we merge by updating the end time
            merged[-1][1] = max(merged[-1][1], interval[1])
    
    return merged
```

> "So here’s what’s happening:
> First, we sort the intervals so we can process them in order of their start times.
> We initialize an empty list called `merged`.
> For each interval, we check if it overlaps with the last one in `merged`.
> If not, we just add it.
> If it does overlap, we update the end time of the last merged interval using `max()` to ensure we capture the full range."

> "Let me now show you the same logic in JavaScript."

```javascript
var merge = function(intervals) {
    // Step 1: Sort the intervals by the start time
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    const merged = [];

    // Step 2: Traverse each interval
    for (let interval of intervals) {
        // If no overlap, push current interval
        if (merged.length === 0 || merged[merged.length - 1][1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.push(interval);
        } else {
            // Merge by updating the end time
            merged[merged.length - 1][1] = Math.max(
                merged[merged.length - 1][1],
                interval[1]
            );
        }
    }

    return merged;
};
```

> "Same concept here: sort, check overlap, merge if needed."

---

### ⏱️ 5. Discuss Time and Space Complexity

> "Let’s analyze the time and space complexity.

* **Time complexity:** Sorting takes O(n log n), and the traversal is O(n), so the total is **O(n log n)**.
* **Space complexity:** We use extra space for the result list, which in the worst case could store all intervals, so it's **O(n)**."

---

### 🤔 6. Mention Follow-up Questions

> "Some follow-up questions that could come up might be:

* How would you handle intervals with negative numbers or extremely large values?
* What if the intervals are provided as objects instead of lists?
* Can we do this in-place if the input array is allowed to be modified?
* What if we want to return the total number of merged intervals instead of the intervals themselves?"

> "I’m happy to walk through any of those directions."

> 讓我先確認我是否理解這個問題。
> 我們會得到一個由區間組成的陣列，每個區間是一組 `[start, end]`。
> 我們的任務是把所有有重疊的區間合併起來，並回傳一個新的陣列。
> 只要兩個區間有重疊（也就是前一個的結束時間大於後一個的開始時間），我們就要把它們合併成一個。

> 是這樣對嗎？有沒有什麼額外的限制條件，例如值的範圍或是輸入的大小？

---

### 🔍 2. Discuss Edge Cases｜討論邊界條件

#### 💬 English

> Let me quickly walk through some edge cases:

* If the input array is empty, we should return an empty array.
* If there's only one interval, then no merging is needed—we return that interval as-is.
* If no intervals overlap at all, then the result should be the same as the input.
* If all intervals overlap into one big range, we should merge them all together.

> Also, should the output intervals be sorted? I assume we don't need to preserve the original order as long as the merging is correct.

#### 📝 中文

> 我來快速走過幾個邊界條件的情況：

* 如果輸入是空陣列，那就回傳空陣列。
* 如果只有一個區間，就不需要合併，直接回傳那個區間。
* 如果沒有任何區間有重疊，那麼結果應該和輸入一樣。
* 如果所有的區間都彼此重疊，那就應該合併成一個大的區間。

> 順便問一下，結果的區間需要排序嗎？我假設只要合併正確，就不需要維持原本的順序。

### 🛠️ 3. Brute-force vs Optimal Approach｜暴力法與最佳解法比較

#### 💬 English

> Let's consider the brute-force approach first.
> We could compare every pair of intervals and merge them when necessary, but that would be O(n²), which isn’t ideal for performance.

> A better approach would be:

1. Sort the intervals by their start time.
2. Use a result list to store merged intervals.
3. Traverse the list and merge if the current interval overlaps with the last one in the result.

#### 📝 中文

> 我們先來看看暴力法的想法。
> 我們可以每對區間都兩兩比較，如果有重疊就合併。但這樣會有 O(n²) 的時間複雜度，效率太差。

> 更好的解法是這樣：

1. 把所有區間依照起始時間排序。
2. 使用一個結果陣列來存放合併後的區間。
3. 遍歷每個區間，若與上一個區間有重疊就合併，否則直接加入結果陣列。

#### 🗣️ Spoken-style Explanation

> “We first sort the intervals based on their start time. Then, we go through each interval. If there’s no overlap, we simply add it to the result. If there is overlap, we merge the current interval with the last one by updating the end time. In the end, we return the `merged` list.”

> * Traversing the intervals takes O(n).
>   So the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.
>   For space complexity, we store the result in a new list, which can be up to O(n) in size.

#### 📝 中文

> * 排序的時間複雜度是 O(n log n)。
> * 遍歷所有區間是 O(n)。
>   所以總時間複雜度是 **O(n log n)**。
>   空間複雜度是 **O(n)**，因為我們會存放一個結果陣列。

### 🤔 6. Follow-up Questions｜延伸問題討論

#### 💬 English

> Some follow-ups could be:

* How would we handle intervals with negative numbers or very large numbers?
* What if intervals are objects instead of arrays?
* Can we do it in-place if allowed to mutate the input?
* What if instead of merged intervals, we just needed the total count?

#### 📝 中文

> 有一些延伸問題可能是：

* 如果區間內有負數或是很大的數值怎麼辦？
* 如果每個區間是物件而不是陣列，要怎麼修改？
* 如果允許修改原始輸入，我們能不能就地處理？
* 如果我們不需要合併結果，只需要算出合併後有幾個區間，怎麼做？
