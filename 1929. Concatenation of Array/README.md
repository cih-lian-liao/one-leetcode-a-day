# Problem 1929: Concatenation of Array

### Problem Summary
Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, we need to create an array `ans` of length `2 * n`, where:
- `ans[i] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n`, and
- `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n`.

In simpler terms, `ans` should contain `nums` followed by `nums` again.

#### Example
- **Input:** `nums = [1,2,1]`
- **Output:** `ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]`

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Requirement**  
   We need to repeat the given array `nums` and concatenate it with itself.

2. **Determine an Approach**  
   Python allows easy list concatenation with the `+` operator. Using `nums + nums` will produce the desired result.

3. **Optimize for Simplicity**  
   This approach has an O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of `nums`, making it efficient and easy to understand.

### Code Implementation

```python
def getConcatenation(nums):
    return nums + nums
```

### Explanation for a Coding Interview

#### 1. **State the Problem in Your Own Words**  
   "We need to create a new list by concatenating `nums` with itself. This produces a list that starts with the elements of `nums` and repeats them once more."

#### 2. **Describe the Approach**  
   "To achieve this, I can use Python's list concatenation feature. Since `nums + nums` combines `nums` with itself, it’s both readable and efficient."

#### 3. **Complexity Analysis**  
   - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)** because concatenating lists of length `n` takes linear time.
   - **Space Complexity:** **O(n)** since we’re creating a new list twice the size of `nums`.

#### 4. **Discuss Edge Cases**
   - **Empty Input** (`nums = []`): `nums + nums` returns an empty list, which is the expected result.
   - **Single Element** (`nums = [a]`): Returns `[a, a]`, which is correct.

### Conclusion
This approach is simple, efficient, and easy to explain in a coding interview, making it a good solution for this problem.
